Here is a SQL query with an inner join

SELECT DISTINCT (A.country),
       COUNT (DISTINCT D.customer id) AS all customer count.
       COUNT (DISTINCT A.country) AS top_customer_count
FROM country A
INNER JOIN city B
      ON A.country_id = B.country_id
INNER JOIN address C
      ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN customer D
      ON C.address id = D.address id
LEFT JOIN (SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, E.country, B.city, SUM(C.amount) AS total_amount_paid
      FROM customer A
      INNER JOIN address D
            ON A.address id = D.address id
      INNER JOIN city B
            ON D.city_id = B.city_id
      INNER JOIN country E
            ON .country_id = E.country_id
      INNER JOIN payment C
ON A.customer ID = C.customer id
      WHERE E.country IN
              ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
      AND B.city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule', kKurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya'. 'So Leopoldo')
      GROUP BY A.customer_id, E.country, B.city
      ORDER BY total amount_paid DESC
      LIMIT 5) AS top_5 customers
      ON A.country = top_5_customers.COUNTRY
